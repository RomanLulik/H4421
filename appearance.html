                <p><br>
                        <b>In 2007, the third generation of the C-class appeared (factory index W204). By tradition,
                        the styling of the car is borrowed from the S-class, in this case the W221 model. It is
                        also produced in three performance lines. But if for W202 and W203, the performance lines
                        were cosmetic, then for the 204th, the difference between them became greater. On the Sport
                        version, the three-pointed star has been moved from the hood to the grille.The C-class in this
                        body is also available in the BlueEfficiency version, the most economical among all others.
                        In 2011, the C-class coupe was introduced. The fourth generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-class
                        with the factory index W205 with a sedan body debuted in early 2014 at the Detroit Auto Show.
                        At the end of 2014, the station wagon version debuted. At the end of 2015, a coupe version was
                        introduced. The convertible version debuted in 2016. The car is built on the MRA platform
                        (the same as the S-class). The length of the car is 4686 mm, the wheelbase is 2840 mm, the
                        volume of the trunk is 480 liters. The coupe version has 300 liters of cargo space, the cabriolet
                        - 250 liters [1]. The car will receive a version with air suspension.</b><br />
