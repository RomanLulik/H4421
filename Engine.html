                <p><br>
                    <b>In March 2000, the presentation of the second generation of the C-class (body W203) took place.
                    Outwardly, the car was similar to the S-class W220, with the same rounded body, and inside a more 
                    spacious interior with a more ergonomic layout.Like its predecessor, the car had several performance
                    lines â€” standard Classic, luxurious Elegance and sporty Avantgarde.The car was famous for its economy,
                    a significant part of the fleet of released cars was the CDI diesel version, also on the W203, Mercedes
                    used Common Rail technology for gasoline engines (CGI) for the first time.In 2001, the station wagon
                    S203 appeared and at the same time the three-door liftback CL203 Sportcoupe. AMG flagship models
                    originally consisted of the C32 (V6) but in 2003, as an experiment, the tuner presented the first
                    (and so far only) diesel model C30 CDI (I5), but in 2005 it was withdrawn from production. In 2004,
                    the C32 was replaced by the more powerful C55 (V8).Production of the sedan and station wagon ended
                    in 2007, and the liftback in 2008 received a major update and was allocated to its Mercedes-BenzCLC-Class. </b><br />
