                    <b>The first generation of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class with the W202 body was produced from 1993 to 2001
                    Despite the 190's success over 11 years, by the early 1990s the car was clearly out of date and in
                    need of a replacement. The model classification system turned out to be the most outdated. Despite
                    the nine different volumes of engines, the "190" index was kept on all of them, to distinguish the
                    model from more expensive business class models, is indicated by an index starting with two hundred-W123
                    and W124. In 1993, it was replaced by the long-awaited replacement, which already refers to itself as "C-klasse".
                    Externally, the C-class turned out to be larger than its predecessor, and it was offered at once in four
                    performance lines, starting from the standard Classic, toned-down. In 1997, the car received restyling, the
                    main point of which was the addition to the range of engines of a more economical four-cylinder forced M111,
                    equipped with a compressor and diesel OM611 CDI with a Common-Rail system. n 1996, another C-class model,
                    the station wagon S202, appeared. On the basis of the sedan, the C208 coupe and the A208 convertible were
                    also developed as part of the CLK class. AMG, being an official tuner since 1992, presented three models,
                    the first in 1993 was the C36, but in 1997 it was replaced by the more powerful C43 with a V8 engine.
                    After the purchase of the tuner in 1999, a small series of C55 also appeared. </b><br />
